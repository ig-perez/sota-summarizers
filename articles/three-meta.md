# Remote-first work is taking over the rich world (922 words)

## Article's TLDR
IN FEBRUARY 2020 Americans on average spent 5% of their working hours at home. By May, as lockdowns spread, the share had soared to 60%—a trend that was mirrored in other countries. Many people, perhaps believing that working from home really meant shirking from home, assumed that office life would soon return to something like its pre-pandemic norm. To say it has not turned out that way would be a huge understatement.

## Main ideas for me
- 40% of all American working hours are still now spent at home.
- It is expected an increase in the number of days a week worked from home.
- Workers hope they will spend closer to half their working hours at the kitchen table.
- Economists try to find out how productivity is affected due to these periods of remote work.
- Perceptions about the future of office work are changing. Politicans and companies are less prone to exhort workers to get back to the office.
- An intriguing possibility explains why remote-first work remains dominant. Work that is largely done remotely may be more efficient/productive compared with an office-first model.
- Economists have less insight into why remote workers might be more productive. Some possibilities that can explain this phenomena can be it is more easily focus on tasks than in an office, removing the tirediness related to commuting, and technology helps to co-ordinate teams more effectively.
- Yet, if it is so wonderful, then why is there little evidence of a shift towards “fully remote” work, where firms shut down their offices altogether? It seems moving to a fully remote scheme might affect innovation since remote work makes people’s collaboration practices more “static and siloed” a study has found.
- Firms will have to experiment the precise arrangement that best work for them: come into the office a few days a week versus bring people together with the express purpose of discussing new ideas.
- What seems clear, though, is that offices will still have a role after the pandemic—even if they are mostly empty.

## My summary
40% of American employees are still working from home. They hope that about half their working hours happen remotely. Economists are trying to find out how productivity is affected due to this remote-first schema. As it seems work mainly done remotely may be more efficient/productive compared with the office-first model, politicians and companies are less prone to exhort workers to get back to the office. But why remote workers might be more productive? Some possibilities are that employees more easily focus on tasks at home than in an office, there is no tiredness related to commuting, and technology helps coordinate teams more effectively. Yet, why is there little evidence of a shift towards fully remote work? A study has found that a fully remote scheme makes people's collaboration practices more static and siloed, possibly affecting innovation. Offices will still have a role after the pandemic—even if they are mostly empty. Firms will have to experiment with the precise arrangement that best works for them: come into the office a few days a week versus bring people together with the express purpose of discussing new ideas.
