## Article's TLDR
DISASTER STRUCK the world’s biggest social network on October 4th when Facebook and its sister apps were knocked offline for six hours. It was one of the less embarrassing moments of the company’s week. The next day a whistleblower, Frances Haugen, told Congress of all manner of wickedness at the firm, from promoting eating disorders to endangering democracy. Some wondered whether the world would be a better place if the outage were permanent.

## Main ideas for me
- Facebook's reputational problems make bad news stand out over good news (even when Facebook does the right thing). For example, one in five teens feel bad about themselves when using Instagram, but two feel better.
- Everyone looks mostly to Facebook when it comes to other problems inherent to the Internet in general (i.e., regulation of viral content for kids).
- The most damaging claim revealed this week is that Facebook has hidden projections from its investors that it could lose 45% of its US adolescent users in two years. This kind of deception could have catastrophic consequences since advertiser sales are the source of almost all of the company's revenue.
- Despite all these reputational problems, politicians seem incapable of co-ordinating reform to rein it in, and investors have kept buying the stock.
- It seems that Facebook is nearing a reputational point of no return, causing people to no longer want to hear their explanations. This situation increases the possibility of losing its young and liberal staff and thwarting its plans (i.e., the metaverse).
- It is recommended that Facebook look hard at its public face, Mark Zuckerberg, who increasingly looks like a liability.

## My summary
Facebook is nearing a reputational point of no return. The latest events cause people to no longer want to hear their explanations. Increase the possibility of losing its young and liberal staff. Thwart its plans (i.e., the metaverse). Make bad news stand out over good news (even when Facebook does the right thing and problems blamed on them are inherent to the Internet in general), and jeopardize investor relationships that could have catastrophic consequences on their revenue. Facebook would be good to look hard at its public face, Mark Zuckerberg, who increasingly looks like a liability.
