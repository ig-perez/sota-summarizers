## Article's TLDR
19 million people who would have otherwise been paralyzed are now walking today thanks to heroes like Shumaila Rehmani.

## Main ideas for me
- Polio is almost eradicated from Earth. Cases have fallen 99.9% in the last 33 years thanks to vaccination.
- Polio vaccines save lives and avoid people from paralysis.
- Shumaila Rehmani is a Pakistani doctor that goes door to door vaccinating children.
- Vaccination is hard since some parents don't want them based on misinformation and fear
- Shumaila speaks with the community to address the importance and harmless of the vaccines
- COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted polio vaccination and many polio outbreaks have appeared in Africa and Asia
- The Global Polio Eradication Initiative works to contain COVID-19 and polio at the same time.
- Pakistani government will start a campaign in November to vaccinate every child aiming to join other countries like Nigeria where polio was eradicated last year. 

## My summary
We are near to eradicating polio on the planet, thanks to childhood vaccination. COVID-19 has disrupted vaccination, causing some outbreaks to appear in Africa and Asia. Polio can kill and paralyze people, but some parents avoid vaccines because of fear and misinformation. Door-to-door doctors like Pakistani's Shumila Rehmani fight these problems with talks, patience, and planning. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative helps with both polio eradication and COVID-19 containment. Hopefully, Pakistan will eradicate polio this year with their November vaccination campaign and join other polio-free countries like Nigeria.
